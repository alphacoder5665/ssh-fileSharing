How to Connect to Termux via SSH from Another Device

This guide assumes you have already successfully set up the SSH server (sshd) within Termux on your Android device.

**ON THE TERMUX (ANDROID) DEVICE FIRST (Recap):**

1.  **Install OpenSSH (if not done):**

    ```bash

    pkg update
    pkg install openssh

    ```

2.  **Set a Password for Termux (if not done):**

    ```bash

    passwd

    ```
    (Enter and confirm your new password)

3.  **Start the SSH Server (sshd):**

    ```bash

    sshd

    ```
    (Termux SSH server usually runs on port 8022)

4.  **Find Termux's IP Address and Username:**

    * **IP Address:** Check your Android Wi-Fi settings for the IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`). Or in Termux, try:

        ```bash

        ifconfig

        ```
        (Look for `inet` under `wlan0` or similar)

    * **Username:** In Termux, run:

        ```bash

        whoami

        ```
        (Usually something like `u0_aXXX`)

**FROM THE OTHER DEVICE (e.g., Laptop, PC, another mobile on the SAME Wi-Fi):**

**1. Connecting from a Linux or macOS Computer (Terminal):**

* Open your terminal.
* Command:

    ```bash

    ssh <your_termux_username>@<your_android_device_ip> -p 8022

    ```

    Example:

    ```bash

    ssh u0_a123@192.168.1.5 -p 8022

    ```
* If prompted about host authenticity, type `yes`.
* Enter the Termux password when prompted.

**2. Connecting from a Windows Computer:**

* **Using PowerShell (Windows 10+):**
    * Open PowerShell.
    * Command:
    
        ```powershell
    
        ssh <your_termux_username>@<your_android_device_ip> -p 8022
        
        ```

        Example:

        ```powershell

        ssh u0_a123@192.168.1.5 -p 8022

        ```
    * Follow prompts for host authenticity and password.

* **Using PuTTY:**
    * Download and open PuTTY.
    * Host Name (or IP address): `<your_android_device_ip>`
    * Port: `8022`
    * Connection type: SSH
    * Click "Open".
    * Accept security alert if it appears.
    * Login as: `<your_termux_username>`
    * Enter Termux password.

**3. Connecting from Another Android or iOS Device:**

* Install an SSH client app (e.g., JuiceSSH, Termius, ConnectBot for Android; Termius, Blink Shell for iOS).

* In the app, create a new connection:

    * Hostname/Address: `<your_android_device_ip>`
    * Port: `8022`
    * Username: `<your_termux_username>`
    * Password: (Enter Termux password)

* Connect.


**Ending the SSH Session (from the Client Device):**

1.  **Type `exit`:** In the SSH terminal connected to Termux, type `exit` and press Enter.

    ```bash

    exit

    ```

2.  **Close the Terminal/Client:** You can usually close the terminal window or the SSH client application.

3.  **SSH Escape Sequence (if stuck):** Press `~` then `.`, then Enter (tilde usually needs to be on a new line).


**Troubleshooting Tips:**

* **"Connection refused":**
    * Ensure `sshd` is running in Termux (`ps aux | grep sshd`). If not, start with `sshd`.
    * Verify IP address and port (8022).
    * Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi.
    * Check for firewalls.
* **"Permission denied" / wrong password:**
    * Verify correct username and password (case-sensitive).
* **Termux going to sleep:**
    * In Termux, run: `termux-wake-lock`
    * Set Termux battery optimization to "Unrestricted" in Android settings.
    * To release lock later: `termux-wake-unlock`
